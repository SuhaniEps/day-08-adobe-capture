        Overview:
    </h2>
    <p1>
        Evidence of climbing dates back to ancient times, with early humans using climbing skills for survivalâ€”hunting, gathering, and escaping predators. The first recorded ascents of notable cliffs and mountains began in Europe in the 18th century. Figures like William Windham and Edward Whymper in the Alps paved the way for modern climbing. The mid-1800s saw the rise of mountaineering as a sport. Climbers sought to conquer iconic peaks in the Alps, including the Matterhorn (first ascended in 1865). The introduction of new gear, such as pitons and ropes, made climbing more accessible and safer.
